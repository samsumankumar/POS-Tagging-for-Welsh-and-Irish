# POS-Tagging-for-Welsh-and-Irish

The above files has the scratch coding of POS tagging done using PyTorch. I have also coded BiDirectional LSTMs from scratch using the pre defined functions of unidirectional LSTMs.

The second file has the same implementation where I have also used character embeddings and then summed those to form the whole word to represent them in the embedding space combined 
together with the respective word embedding.
